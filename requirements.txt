# Core dependencies for Dean's Claude Code customizations

# No external Python dependencies required currently
# All scripts use only Python standard library modules:
# - json (built-in)
# - sys (built-in) 
# - pathlib (built-in)

# If you want to add additional Python-based hooks or commands,
# add dependencies here and update setup.sh to install them
